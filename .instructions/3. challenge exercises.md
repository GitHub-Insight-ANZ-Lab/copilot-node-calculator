# Challenge Exercises

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your programming abilities but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks. Even if you're not a developer, you may be surprised how Copilot can help you be successful with these challenge.


<details>
<summary>Challenge #1 - Adding Unit Tests</summary>

### Adding Unit Tests

1. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code if it is not already open.

2. Enter ```npm test``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to execute the existing unit tests for the Calculator application.

3. Scroll up in the terminal window to see what tests have been executed. You should see tests for Arithmetic validation, Addition, Multiplication and Division. There are no tests for the subtraction function!

4. Open the ```/test/arithmetic.test.js``` file.

5. Scroll down to the line with the comment ```TODO: Challenge #1``` (Around line 96)

6. On the line following the comment, add a new comment to provide context to GitHub Copilot on what you want assistance to do. Try adding this comment ```// add tests for subtraction``` and press ```ENTER``` to generate a suggestion.

7. Accept the suggested line if it looks right by pressing ```TAB``` then ```ENTER```.

8. Continue accepting suggestions line by line to see how many unit tests you can have Copiloit assist you in writing.

9. Once you're happy with a few unit tests, save the file and return to the terminal window. Enter ```npm test``` and press **ENTER** to execute the unit tests again.

**NOTE:** The advanced features currently available in GitHub CopilotX Chat, provide far more sophisticated assistance in writing unit tests, including the ability to write complete test suites for you. At the time of creating this exercise, Copilot Chat was only available as a pre-release experiment.

<summary>Challenge #2 - Adding Unit Tests for the power/exponential function</summary>

### Adding Unit Tests for the power/exponential function

1. See if you can now add additional unit tests for the power/exponential function you created in the core exercise.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Challenge #3 - Adding a new function</summary>

### Adding a new function

1. See if you can now add an entirely new function to the calculator using GitHub Copilot to assist you. The previous exercises will help you locate where you want to add code. 

2. Once your function is working, consider adding the necessary unit tests to confirm it's functionality.

<details>
<summary>Challenge #4 - Fix errors</summary>

### Fix errors
1. Go to the `controller.js` file on line 19, and and a single comma. This will generate a compiler error.
2. Ask Copilot to help you fix the error

<summary>Challenge #5 - Explaining the controller.js file</summary>

### Explaining the controller.js file

1. Navigate to the `controller.js` file in your project.

2. Use GitHub Copilot to help you explain the purpose and functionality of the `controller.js` file. Ask Copilot to generate comments or descriptions for different sections of the code.

3. Review the generated explanations and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure clarity and accuracy.

<summary>Challenge #9 - Improving Code Reuse</summary>

### Improving Code Reuse

1. Navigate to the `controller.js` file in your project.

2. Select the lines between 32 and 42, which contain code that could benefit from better code reuse.

3. Ask Copilot to rewrite the selected code to improve code reuse. Provide a comment to indicate what you want Copilot to do, such as `// Improve code reuse in this section`.

4. Review the generated suggestions and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure the code is refactored for better code reuse.

5. Test the refactored code to ensure it still functions as expected.

<summary>Challenge #6 - Generating Sample Data for Testing</summary>

### Generating Sample Data for Testing

1. Navigate to the `controller.js` file in your project.

2. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate sample data that can be used for testing. Ask Copilot Chat to provide at least 3 lines of sample data for each test.

3. Review the generated sample data and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure it meets your testing requirements.

<summary>Challenge #7 - Generating Documentation</summary>

### Generating Documentation

1. Navigate to the `controller.js` file in your project.

2. Use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for the `controller.js` file. Ask Copilot to provide comments or descriptions for different sections of the code, explaining the purpose and functionality of each section.

3. Review the generated documentation and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure clarity and accuracy.

4. Repeat the same process for the `index.html` file, generating documentation for different sections of the code.

<summary>Challenge #8 - Converting to CSharp</summary>

### Converting to CSharp

1. Navigate to the `controller.js` file in your project.

2. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to assist you in converting the `controller.js` file into CSharp code. Ask Copilot Chat to provide suggestions and guidance on how to rewrite the code in CSharp.

3. Review the generated suggestions and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure the code is correctly converted to CSharp.
